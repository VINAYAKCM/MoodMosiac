# MoodMosiac
MoodMosaic is a personal mood tracker that goes beyond basic logging. Each day, you record your mood and a brief note about why you feel that way. Over time, our AI analyzes these entries to highlight patterns, identify common triggers, and offer gentle suggestions for improving emotional well-being.
