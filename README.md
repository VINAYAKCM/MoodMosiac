# MoodMosiac
MoodMosaic is a personal mood tracker that goes beyond basic logging. Each day, you record your mood and a brief note about why you feel that way. Over time, our AI analyzes these entries to highlight patterns, identify common triggers, and offer gentle suggestions for improving emotional well-being.

Key Features:

• Simple Daily Logging: Quickly select a mood and add a brief note. A few seconds each day is all it takes to build a rich emotional timeline.

• AI-Driven Insights: Using NLP and basic machine learning, our AI uncovers recurring themes (e.g., “stress often appears after late-night work”) and reflects these patterns back to you.

• Personalized Suggestions: Beyond just patterns, the AI provides gentle, context-based suggestions. If certain activities consistently lead to happiness or stress, you’ll see tailored advice on how to manage or encourage those emotional states.

• Visual History & Summaries: Charts, timelines, and word clouds help you see how your mood evolves over weeks, months, and beyond. Monthly AI-generated summaries narrate your emotional journey, making it easier to understand where you’ve been and where you’re going.
